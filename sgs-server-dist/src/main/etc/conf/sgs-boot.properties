# SGS Bootup configuration

# This file is used to configure JVM environment
# information for booting up the Project Darkstar
# Server
#
###################################################

# This property denotes the installation directory
# for the Project Darkstar server.  If not set,
# this is automatically determined based on the
# location of the boot jar
#
#SGS_HOME = 

# Set this property if you wish to change the default
# directory where SGS searches for application jar
# files.
#
#SGS_DEPLOY = ${SGS_HOME}/deploy

# Set this property to change the default properties
# file used to configure the SGS Kernel.  The
# SGS_PROPERTIES defines a set of default configuration
# properties that can be overridden by the application's
# specific properties file.
#
#SGS_PROPERTIES = ${SGS_HOME}/conf/sgs-server.properties

# Set this property to change the default logging
# properties file used when running the Project Darkstar
# Server.
#
#SGS_LOGGING = ${SGS_HOME}/conf/sgs-logging.properties

# Set this property to configure a filename that the server
# will output logging information to.  If this is left
# blank, log output will be printed to standard output.
# By default, this property is blank.
#
#SGS_LOGFILE = 

# Set this property to configure the flavor of BerkeleyDB
# that is to be used when running the Project Darkstar Server.
# Valid values for this property are:
#  db - To denote using the BerkeleyDB Native edition
#  je - To denote using the BerkeleyDB Java edition
#  custom - To denote using neither
# The default value for this property is db.  If the value of
# this property is set to custom, neither the db nor je jar
# files from the ${SGS_HOME}/lib directory will be included
# on the classpath.
#
#BDB_TYPE = db

# Set this property to change the location of the 
# BerkeleyDB native libraries to use when running the 
# Project Darkstar server.  By default this will be
# automatically set by detecting platform and architecture
# type.
#
#BDB_NATIVES = 

# Set this property to include additional native library paths.
# If this property is set, it will be combined with the value
# of ${BDB_NATIVES} to form the java.library.path passed to 
# the JVM at runtime.
#
#CUSTOM_NATIVES =

# Set this property to include additional jar files on the 
# classpath to be used when running the Project Darkstar JVM.
# The use of this property is typically not necessary unless:
#   * the value of ${BDB_TYPE} is set to custom AND
#   * the custom bdb type being used is included in a jar
#     whose filename begins with "db-" or "je-"
# In most other cases, dropping additional jar files into the
# ${SGS_DEPLOY} or ${SGS_HOME}/lib directory is sufficient
# for them to be included on the classpath.
#
#CUSTOM_CLASSPATH_ADD =

# Set this property to change the port that the Project Darkstar
# Server will listen on for SHUTDOWN commands.
#
#SHUTDOWN_PORT = 1138

# Set this property to change the JDK used
#
#JAVA_HOME = 

# This property will be used to pass additional command line
# options to the JVM at runtime.  By default, the JAVA_OPTS
# property is empty.
#
#JAVA_OPTS = -server -XX:+AggressiveOpts -Xmx768M -XX:NewRatio=1

  <h3>A Project Darkstar Game</h3>
  </center>


  <p><b>Project Overview:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hack project is an
  multiplayer, 2D, rogue-like RPG built using the Project Darkstar MMO
  application server stack.  The project also serves as a
  well-documented, example for how to build MMO-like games using
  Project Darkstar technology.  The Hack code is released into the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">Creative Commons Public Domain</a>
  and is available for unrestricted use.</p>

	  <p>Like any growing project, we have done our best to
	  provide documentation on how to get started and how the
	  project is structured.  New developers and those wanting to
	  start programming MMOs are encourage to start with these
	  pages to get a feel for how the game is structured.</p>
	  
	  <p>Hack was initially built as a protype game as a part of
	  Project Darkstar and was used as a learning example and for
	  performance testing.  Now that PDS has been open sourced,
	  Hack is being developed as a fully-featured game and is
	  simultaneously used to serve as an programming example for
	  new developers wanting to learn how to develop games using
	  PDS.</p>

  <h3>A Project Darkstar Game</h3>

    <h1>Design Document</h1>
  </center>

  <br><br>

  This design document is always a work in progress and reflects a
  best-effort on the part of the developers to explain how the various
  parts of the system are designed.  Feedback is <i>always</i> welcome
  and can be sent to the dev mailing list.<br/>

  
  <h3>Client-Server Communication</h3>
  
  <p>The following diagram illustrates the core communication between
    the client and the server.  Each of the various numbers represents
    some type of interaction is described in detail below.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The client initially connects to the server by way
    of <tt>GameSimBoot</tt>, which is the AppListener on the server
    side.  If the client does not already have a player, they are
    moved to the creator stage of the game.  Otherwise, the client's
    already-created player is used and the client is moved to the
    lobby.</li>

    <li><tt>Messages</tt> serves as the main class on the server side
    for encoding the various commands and sending them to channels and
    client sessions.  All the server components use this class instead
    of sending the messages themselves.  This reduces the chance for
    any message formatting inconsistencies.</li>

    <li>The <tt>Player</tt> class is responsible for maintaining the
      client's server side state.  The various game-stage controllers
      will update this object based on the commands received and the
      actions of other characters in the game.</li>

    <li>The creator channel contains all the broadcasted
    traffic from the server.  This is typically any new player's id
    and name.  The client will send requests on this channel to create
    a new character.  None of the messages send from the client on
    this channel are sent to any other clients.</li>

    <li>The lobby channel handles messages about joining a new game.
    The server will broadcast on it regarding any new games that are
    added.  Clients will send back requests to join games on this
    channel.  None of the messages send from the client on this
    channel are sent to any other clients.</li>


    <li>The dungeon channel contains all the updates to the current
    dungeon that the client is connected to.  These include any
    movement updates from other players.  None of the messages send
    from the client on this channel are sent to any other clients
    directly.  Any movements commands are first processed by the
    server before being sent on this channel.</li>


    <li>The <tt>SimpleClient</tt> used by the Hack <tt>Client</tt>
    receives all the messages sent directly using
    the <tt>ClientSession</tt> on the server-side.  These messages are
    typically reponses that pertain only to that player and should not
    be broadcasted.  The Hack <tt>Client</tt> processes these messages
    as they are received.</li>

    <li>The <tt>CreatorManager</tt> and <CreatorChannelListener</tt>
    contain all the character creation logic on the client side.  The
    former sends all of the outgoing messages, while the latter is
    reponsible for processing all of the broadcasted updates on the
    creator channel.</li>


    <li>The <tt>LobbyManager</tt> and <LobbyChannelListener</tt>
    contain all the game-choosing logic on the client side.  The
    former sends all of the outgoing messages regarding which dungeon
    a client will join, while the latter is reponsible for processing
    all of the broadcasted updates on the lobby channel.</li>


    <li>The <tt>GameManager</tt> and <DungeonChannelListener</tt>
    contain all the dungeon-related logic on the client side, such as
    moving.  The former sends all of the outgoing messages, while the
    latter is reponsible for processing all of the broadcasted updates
    on the dungeon channel.</li>

    <li>The <tt>GamePanel</tt> is a part of the GUI logic that is
    responsible for processing key commands while a player is in the
    dungeon.  It forwards these commands to the <tt>GameManager</tt>
    as requests for the current player to be moved.</li>

    <li>The <tt>Creator</tt> and <tt>CreatorMessageHandler</tt>
    contain all the server-side logic for dealing with character
    creation.  The former is responsible for sending out all messages
    and updates.  The latter listens for any commands sent to the
    server on the creator channel.</li>

    <li>The <tt>Lobby</tt> and <tt>LobbyMessageHandler</tt> contain
    all the server-side logic for dealing with a player while they are
    in the lobby.  The former is responsible for sending out all
    messages and updates.  The latter listens for any commands sent to
    the server on the lobby channel.</li>

    <li>The <tt>Dungeon</tt> and <tt>DungeonMessageHandler</tt>
    contain all the server-side logic for dealing with a player while
    they are in a dungeon.  The former is responsible for sending out
    all messages and updates.  The latter listens for any commands
    sent to the server on the dungeon channel.  When a player dies in
    a dungeon, they are sent back to the lobby state of the game by
    the <tt>Dungeon</tt>.</li>

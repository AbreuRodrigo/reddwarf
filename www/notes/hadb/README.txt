Instructions and tarballs for installing HADB for use by Project DarkStar.

1.  solaris.txt - sets up a vanilla solaris machine to run HADB with the
    proper configuration for DarkStar.

2.  install-hadb.txt - installs the tarballs and sets up the necessary
    directories.

    Steps 1 and 2 may be done in either order, as far as I can tell.
    Steps 1 and 2 must precede step 3.

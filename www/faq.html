	<p style="text-indent:-30px;"> <b>What is Hack?</b></p>
	
	<p>Hack is a fully-working small 2D dungeon crawler game
	  with a playable client and server.  The game is very similar
	  to a graphical,
	  generic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(computer_game)">Rogue</a>-like
	  game.  Right now it's a bit light on game-specific logic,
	  but this is because our primary goals was to develop all the
	  application logic needed, such as dealing with clients,
	  having characters move, processing messages, etc.  As a part
	  of this goal, we designed the system to be highly extensible
	  so later developers could add their own improvements.  Some
	  of the current features are:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Client login and hooks for passwords and authentication</li>
	      <li>Character classes and stats</li>
	      <li>A Lobby where players can choose which dungeon to visit</li>
	      <li>A configurable dungeon, creature and NPC system where developers can easily design their own dungeons.</li>
	      <li>A minimal combat system where the player can kill and be killed by creatures.</li>
	      <li>A 2D graphical client for the player (screen shot below) and a large sprite map for extending the game with new player classes and objects.</li>
	    </ul>

	<p style="text-indent:-30px;"> <b>Where did Hack come from?</b><p/>
	  
	<p>Hack was initially built as an internal game as a part of
	  <a href="https://games-darkstar.dev.java.net/">Project
	  Darkstar</a> (PDS).  Now that PDS has been open sourced,
	  Hack has also been released under the Creative Commons
	  license and is being developed as its own game.</p>

	<p style="text-indent:-30px;"> <b>What purpose does Hack
	serve?</b><p/>
	  
	<p>Hack has several goals:
	  <ol>
	    <li>First, we want Hack to be an exciting, playable game
	    and a place for developers to try new features.  One of
	    the most rewarding things about game development is being
	    able to play the result (and enjoy it!).  Development
	    direction will be driven by the community and based on
	    what features people would like to see.
	    </li>
	    
	    <li><p>We want Hack to serve as a great example of how to
	    develop RPG-like games with Project Darkstar (PDS).  The
	    first part of this goal includes writing design
	    documents to explain the system and adding lots of
	    documentation in the code about the design choices
	    involved.</p>
	      
	      <p>The second part of this goal is to make it easier for
	    new developers on the project to get started quickly.  As
	    a part of this, we want to keep a current list of
	    requested features so new developers can easily see what
	    things they might want to work on.  As a second part, we
	    want to be open to new ideas, and let developers freely
	    test out features that they think would be interesting.
	    </p></li>
	    
	    <li><p>Our third goal is be an exmplar PDS community member
	    by providing real-world game data for testing PDS itself,
	    and documenting all PDS issues, performance bottlenecks
	    and enhancement-requests.  If we are suceeding in the
	    first two goals, the first part of this goal should
	    require no effort.  Given that this project depends on
	    PDS, we want to provide meaningful data about PDS
	    performance, which lets PDS developers beter tune the
	    system.</p>
	      
	      <p>The second part of this goal requires active
	    participatiaon and analysis of Hack performance.  As new
	    features are added, Hack will undoubtedly run into issues
	    and performance bottlenecks.  As a part of this, we want
	    to be active in documenting these and letting the PDS team
	    know about anything that could be improved or added to
	    their system to alleviate them.
	    </p></li>

	<p style="text-indent:-30px;"> <b>If I add feature X, can I
	use the code again later in a different project?</b><p/>
	  
	<p>Yes, and not only that, you can use all the other code in
	the Hack project as well.  Hack was released under the
	Creative Commons license for this very purpose.  Often when
	new game developers are just starting out, they want to try
	implementing some cool feature or gameplay option, but the
	minimal programming investment to get the game running is so
	large, they give up before finishing.  We would like to see
	new developers try programming with Hack first and adding the
	things they want, and then taking their new game-programming
	knowledge and their code to develop their own games.  (or they can keep working on Hack too <img src="images/smiley.gif"/>)</p>

	    Then it might be due an old version of maven.  We've seen

	<td align="left">
	  
	  <p style="text-indent:-30px;"> <b>What are all these subprojects?</b><p/>
	    
	  <p>We have divided the code base into four logically
	  separate Maven subprojects:
	    <ol>
	      <li><b><tt>hack-client:</tt></b><p>The client project
	      encompasses all the client-side code for processing
	      messages and displaying the game state in a GUI.</p></li>
	      <li><b><tt>hack-ai:</tt></b> <p>The ai project is a
	      headless client that connects to the server, creates a
	      character, then joins a game and begins randomly
	      wandering around.  This project's runtime configuration
	      lets you specify how many AI clients to connect, which
	      is useful for stress testing how many clients a
	      particular server configuration can handle before
	      performance problems set in.  The AI project has a
	      dependency on parts of the client project for its
	      message processing.</p></li>
	      <li><b><tt>hack-server:</tt></b> <p>The server is where all
	      the server-side code for manipulating game state and
	      handling client messages lives.  Currently, the server
	      also has knowledge of parts of the GUI, notably the
	      tileset, and the client can request these informatin
	      from the server.</p></li>
	      <li><b><tt>hack-shared:</tt></b> <p>The shared project is
	      the only non-runnable project in the group.  It contains
	      all the shared code between the client project and
	      server.  It also contains all the messaging and command
	      classes, along with utilities for encoding the various
	      game commands into network-ready data types.</p></li>
	    </ol>
	  </p>
	  
	</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
	<td width="25"></td>
	<td align="left">
	  
	  <p style="text-indent:-30px;"> <b>How do I run this?</b><p/>
	    
	  <p>We have application run commands in the Maven pom.xml so
	  you can start things from the command line as follows:
	    <ol>
	      <li><b><tt>hack-client:</tt></b> <tt>mvn process-test-resources -Ptest-run</tt></li>
	      <li><b><tt>hack-ai:</tt></b> <tt>mvn process-test-resources -Ptest-run</tt></li>
	      <li><b><tt>hack-server:</tt></b> <tt>mvn process-test-resources -Psingle-node-server</tt></li>
	    </ol>

	    The Hack client and ai projects can take optional
	    parameter <tt>hack.host</tt> to specificy which machine to
	    connect to.  The ai project also has the optional
	    parameter <tt>ai.clients</tt> to specify how many clients
	    should connect from the new JVM.  These properties should
	    be specified on the command line using the
	    "-D<i>property</i>=value" syntax.

	  graphics.  (Shameless plug: if you're a graphic designer, or
	  want to try writing a cool GUI, this is your chance.) More

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
This package contains the code code for the Communications layer (tier 1) of 
the Sun Game Server Technology.

The Communications layer is divided up into 3 sub functions. Routing, 
User Managers and Discovery.  There is a seperate sub-package for each.

<b>Discovery:</b> Discovery is the process of the client finding a User Manager 
to connect to.  It is the first step in the connection process.  Discoverers are
pluggable.  The common interfaces a discovery module must implement and and all 
of the different Sun supplied modules live in the discovery sub-package.

<b>User Manager:</b> The User Managers encapsulate the connection protocols for 
all the different kinds of devices that can connect to the game server.  The
rest of the Game Server stack is 100% agnostic to how the client is connected.
User managers are also pluggable and one game session in the logic layer 
can support multiple different simultaneous communciations layer User Managers.

The common interfaces a UserManager module must implement and and all 
of the different Sun supplied modules live in the users sub-package.

<b>Routing:</b> The routing code facilitates the movement of data between
clients and to and from client and server in a scalable and fault-tolerant 
manner.   The interfaces that define the connection betwene the router and the
rest of the system as well as the source code of the current implementation
reside in the routing package.

WorkloadGeneratorService

This service is designed to generate a steady load of work
in the form of transactional tasks submitted to the
TransactionScheduler.  Upon startup, the service initiates a set
of self-replicating task generators that submit tasks to the
TransactionScheduler with an exponential distribution of interarrival
times.  The result is a standard "Poisson" distribution of events that
simulates a realistic workload of tasks.


See the javadoc of WorkloadGeneratorService for more details.  This project
also comes with a custom Profiler that is enabled by default and that
prints out statistics to the console and also to a file once every 5 seconds.
In order to run the default configuration:

mvn clean verify -Prun-server

In order to run the server using BDB JE and with a different version of PDS:

mvn clean verify -Prun-server,je -Dsgs-server.version=0.9.12-SNAPSHOT

A number of configuration properties are available to customize the runtime of
the service.  For example, in order to change the number of task generators and
the number of objects that are accessed for write in each transaction (default is 2):

mvn clean verify -Prun-server -Djvm.args.extra="-Dcom.sun.sgs.tests.workload.generators=500 \
 -Dcom.sun.sgs.tests.workload.writes=0"

See the javadocs for additional configuration options.

Project Darkstar Client API Pack
Version @VERSION@

INTRODUCTION

Project Darkstar provides a system that enables developers to write
scalable, reliable, persistent and fault-tolerant game server
applications using simple single-threaded, event-driven code.

This distribution includes the source code needed to develop and run
clients that communicate with each other and with game servers
implemented as applications that run in the Project Darkstar Server
environment.

CONTENTS

The Project Darkstar Client API Pack contains the following
subdirectories:

- src
  Source code files

- test
  Source code for tests

BUILDING

The client makes use of two other open source projects, whose JAR files
should be downloaded and included in the classpath:

- Apache MINA, version 1.1:

  http://mina.apache.org/downloads.html

- Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J), version 1.4:

  http://www.slf4j.org/download.html

KNOWN ISSUES

- The Client API Pack currently only includes a J2SE client
  implementation.  Developers can use the documentation of the network
  protocol to develop other implementations, including ones to support
  different languages.

- I/O throttling has not been implemented in this release, so it is
  possible for clients to overwhelm the server with network traffic and
  cause the server to run out of memory.  As a temporary workaround,
  developers must ensure that clients do not send network traffic faster
  than the server application can process it.

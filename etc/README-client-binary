Sun Game Server Sample Client
Version @VERSION@

INTRODUCTION

The Sun Game Server (SGS) is a system that enables developers to write
scalable, reliable, persistent and fault-tolerant game server
applications using simple single-threaded, event-driven code.

This distribution contains everything you need to develop and run
clients that communicate with each other and with game servers
implemented as applications that run in the SGS environment.

CONTENTS

The SGS Client binary distribution contains the following
subdirectories:

- doc
   Documentation for the SGS client

- lib
   JAR files for developing and running client apps
	
SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The sample client has been tested on the following operating systems and
processors:

- Solaris 10 on SPARC processors and AMD 64-bit processors
- Windows XP SP2 on 32-bit processors
- Redhat Linux EL4 on 32-bit processors
- Mac OS X 10.4 on PowerPC and Intel processors

The sample client requires Java(tm) 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0 or
greater.

It has been tested with version 1.5.0_11 of the J2SE(tm) Runtime
Environment 5.0 on Solaris, Windows, and Linux platforms, and version
1.5.0_07 on Mac OS X platforms.

DEVELOPING AND RUNNING

To develop or run clients, include the following JAR file in your
classpath:

   lib/sgs-client.jar


KNOWN ISSUES

This version of the SDK has the following limitations:

- I/O throttling has not been implemented in this release, so it is
  possible for clients to overwhelm the server with network traffic and
  cause the server to run out of memory.  As a temporary workaround,
  developers must ensure that clients do not send network traffic faster
  than the server application can process it.

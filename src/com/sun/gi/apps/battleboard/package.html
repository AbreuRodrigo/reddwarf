<h2>
Basic Rules
</h2>

This game resembles "BattleShip" in general style.  <p>

<ul>

<li> There are an arbitrary number of players, each denoted by a
    unique name (a short string).  When the necessary number of
    players have joined the game, then play begins immediately.  No
    players may join the game after play has begun.  <p>

    Communication and collaboration between the players is permitted
    (and encouraged).  <p>

<li> Each player controls a region of space that is represented by a
    grid of a fixed width and height, called a "board".  <p>

<li> The contents of the board are initialized at the start of the
    game.  Each grid position must either be VACANT or contain a CITY. 
    Each player is given a predetermined number of cities, which they
    may place arbitrarily on their board, or they may be placed
    randomly.  <p>

    <em> At present the cities are always positioned in a fixed
    arrangement.  This makes debugging easier but makes game-play
    meaningless.  <p> </em>

<li> At the start of the game, each player knows the contents of their
    board, but does not know the contents of the boards of the other
    players (other than knowing the size of the board of each player,
    and the initial number of cities).  <p>

<li> The players are assigned a fixed order in which to take turns. 
    All players are aware of this order, and know when it is their
    turn.  <p>
 
    During a players turn, they may perform exactly one of the
    following actions, after which their turn ends and the turn of the
    next player begins:  <p>

    <ul>

    <li> PASS <p>
    
	Take no action during this turn.  <p>

    <li> BOMB <em>player</em> <em>xpos</em> <em>ypos</em> <p>

	Drop a bomb on the board belonging to the given
	<em>player</em>, and the given location
	(<em>xpos</em>,<em>ypos</em>).  A player may drop a bomb on
	their own board, if they wish, although this is not generally
	considered a sound strategy.  <p>

	The player who has been bombed must immediately tell all of
	the other players the result of the bombing.  There are three
	possible results:  <p>

	<ul>

	<li> HIT - the position of the bomb is the same as a city. 
	    <p>

	    A hit destroys the city.  <p>

	<li> NEAR_MISS - the position is not the same as a city, but
	    is in one of the positions adjacent (including diagonals)
	    to at least one city.  <p>

	<li> MISS - the position is neither a HIT or a NEAR_MISS.  <p>

	</ul> <p>

    <li> TIMEOUT [optional] <p>

	If the player takes no action within a given period of time,
	then their turn is ended as if by a PASS.  <p>

    </ul> <p>

<li> A player may withdraw from the game at any time (without waiting
    for their turn).  A withdrawn player is removed from the order of
    turns and all players are immediately informed of their withdrawl. 
    <p>

<li> After each turn, any player that has no remaining cities is said
    to have <em>lost</em> and is removed from the game.  The losing
    player is removed from the order of turns and all other players
    are informed of this event.  <p>

<li> The game continues until only one player remains.  This player is
    said to have won.  <p>

</ul> <p>

<h2>
Messages
</h2>

<h3>
Client-Initiated
</h3>

<ul>

<li> <kbd>join</kbd> <em>name</em> <p>

    A player joins the game by sending this message to the server. 
    The server responds with one of the following: <p>

    <ul>

    <li> <kbd>ok</kbd> <p>

	The player is permitted to join.  In response, the client must
	send over the location of its cities.  (need format) <p>

    <li> <kbd>already-joined</kbd>

	The player has already joined the current game. <p>

    </ul> <p>

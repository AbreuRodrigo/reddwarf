Project Darkstar C Client SDK, Source Distribution

INTRODUCTION

The source distribution of the Project Darkstar C Client SDK contains the
source code needed to develop and run game clients that communicate with
each other and with game servers implemented with the Project Darkstar
Server.  The Project Darkstar Server is available as a separate
download.


CONTENTS

This distribution contains the following subdirectories:

- chatclient
  Source code for a simple chat example

- sgs
  Source code for the client implementation

- test
  Source code for tests


BUILDING

Unix:

- Ensure that the files etc/sgs.mk and etc/$(UNAME).mk
  contain appropriate settings for your platform.

- Invoke GNU make at the top level:
    % make
  or
    % gmake

- To build the tests:
    % cd test
    % make

- To build the chat client example:
    % cd chatclient
    % make

Windows:

- Ensure that the appropriate compiler tools are available in
  your %Path%.  See env.bat for an example.

- Ensure that the files nmake.mak and etc/nmake.mk contain
  appropriate settings for your platform.  In particular,
  you may need to adjust the paths to the compiler includes and
  libraries in etc/nmake.mk.

- At the top level, invoke nmake.exe:
    > nmake.exe /F nmake.mak

- To build the tests:
    % cd test
    % nmake.exe /F nmake.mak


RUNNING TESTS

- After building the tests (see above), the resulting test
  executables can be run manually.  For example, on Unix:

    % cd test
    % ./buffer_test

  ...and so on with the other test executables.
  

RUNNING THE CHAT CLIENT

The chat client example requires a running SGS server with the
Hello Channels tutorial application running.

After building the chat client (see above), invoke the resulting
executable.  For example, on Unix:

    % cd chatclient
    % ./chat_client

Type "help" at the command prompt for a list of commands.

A simple chat session:

  > login user1 mypass
  > chsend Foo hello
  > srvsend test_direct_send
  > logout

Note that the chat client example includes commands that are not
understood by the tutorial application and will simply be echoed
to the server log.


KNOWN ISSUES

This version of the Project Darkstar C Client SDK has the following
limitations:

- The Windows implementation is incomplete.

- I/O throttling has not been implemented in this release, so it is
  possible for clients to overwhelm the server with network traffic and
  cause the server to run out of memory.  As a temporary workaround,
  developers must ensure that clients do not send network traffic faster
  than the server application can process it.

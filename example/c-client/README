Project Darkstar C Client SDK, Source Distribution
Version @VERSION@

INTRODUCTION

Project Darkstar lets developers write scalable, reliable, persistent
and fault-tolerant game server applications using simple
single-threaded, event-driven code.

The source distribution of the Project Darkstar C Client SDK contains the
source code needed to develop and run game clients that communicate with
each other and with game servers implemented with the Project Darkstar
Server.  The Project Darkstar Server is available as a separate
download.


CONTENTS

This distribution contains the following subdirectories:

- example
  Source code for a simple chat example

- src
  Source code for the client implementation

- test
  Source code for tests


BUILDING

Unix:

- Ensure that the files etc/mk/sgs.mk and etc/mk/$(UNAME).mk
  contain appropriate settings for your platform.

- Invoke GNU make with the target "build" at the top level:
    % make build
  or
    % gmake build

Windows:

- Ensure that the appropriate compiler tools are available in
  your %Path%.  See env.bat for an example.

- Ensure that the files etc/mk/nmake.mk and src/client/c/nmake.mak
  contain appropriate settings for your platform.  In particular,
  you may need to adjust the paths to the compiler includes and
  libraries in etc/mk/nmake.mk.

- In src/client/c, invoke nmake.exe as follows:
    > nmake.exe /F nmake.mak


KNOWN ISSUES

This version of the Project Darkstar C Client SDK has the following
limitations:

- The Windows implementation is incomplete.

- I/O throttling has not been implemented in this release, so it is
  possible for clients to overwhelm the server with network traffic and
  cause the server to run out of memory.  As a temporary workaround,
  developers must ensure that clients do not send network traffic faster
  than the server application can process it.

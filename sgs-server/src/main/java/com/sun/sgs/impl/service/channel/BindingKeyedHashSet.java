/**
 * A scalable implementation of {@code Set} backed by a {@link
 * BindingKeyedHashMap}. 
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Developers may use this class as a drop-in replacement for the {@link
 * java.util.HashSet} class for use in a {@link ManagedObject}. Note that,
 * unlike {@code HashSet}, this class can be used to store {@code
 * ManagedObject} instances directly.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This implementation requires that all elements implement {@link
 * Serializable}.  Attempting to add non-{@code null} elements to the set
 * that do not implement {@code Serializable} will result in an {@link
 * IllegalArgumentException} being thrown.  If an element is an instance of
 * {@code Serializable} but does not implement {@code ManagedObject}, this
 * class will persist the element as necessary; when such an element is
 * removed from the set, it is also removed from the {@code DataManager}.
 * If an element is an instance of {@code ManagedObject}, the developer
 * will be responsible for removing these objects from the {@code
 * DataManager} when done with them.  Developers should not remove these
 * object from the {@code DataManager} prior to removing them from the set.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Applications must make sure that objects used as elements in sets of this
 * class have {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods that return the same
 * values after the elements have been serialized and deserialized.  In
 * particular, elements that use {@link Object#equals Object.equals} and {@link
 * Object#hashCode Object.hashCode} will typically not be equal, and will have
 * different hash codes, each time they are deserialized, and so are probably
 * not suitable for use with this class.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This class marks itself for update as necessary; no additional calls to the
 * {@link DataManager} are necessary when modifying the map.  Developers do not
 * need to call {@code markForUpdate} or {@code getForUpdate} on this set, as
 * this will eliminate all the concurrency benefits of this class.  However,
 * calling {@code getForUpdate} or {@code markForUpdate} can be used if a
 * operation needs to prevent all access to the set.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This class offers constant-time implementations of the {@code add},
 * {@code remove} and {@code contains} methods.  Note that, unlike most
 * collections, the {@code size} method for this class is <u>not</u> a
 * constant-time operations, because it requires accessing all of the
 * entries in the set.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <a name="iterator"></a> The {@code Iterator} for this class implements
 * {@code Serializable}.  A single iterator may be saved by different {@code
 * ManagedObject} instances, which will create distinct copies of the original
 * iterator.  A copy starts its iteration from where the state of the original
 * was at the time of the copy.  However, each copy maintains a separate,
 * independent state from the original and will therefore not reflect any
 * changes to the original iterator.  To share a single {@code Iterator}
 * between multiple {@code ManagedObject} <i>and</i> have the iterator use a
 * consistent view for each, the iterator should be contained within a shared
 * {@code ManagedObject}.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * The iterator does not throw {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * The iterator for this class is stable with respect to the concurrent changes
 * to the associated collection, but may ignore additions and removals made to
 * the set during iteration.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * If a call to the {@link Iterator#next next} method on the iterator causes a
 * {@link ObjectNotFoundException} to be thrown because the return value has
 * been removed from the {@code DataManager}, the iterator will still have
 * successfully moved to the next entry in its iteration.  In this case, the
 * {@link Iterator#remove remove} method may be called on the iterator to
 * remove the current object even though that object could not be returned.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * This class and its iterator implement all optional operations.  This set
 * does not support {@code null} elements.  This set provides no guarantees
 * on the order of elements when iterating.

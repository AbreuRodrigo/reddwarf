The files in this directory are intended to be used to test
compatibility of APIs and persistent data structures across releases of
Project Darkstar.

There are three Ant targets of interest:

* run-server-clean - Runs the application, but first creates an empty
  directory for holding persistent state.

* run-server - Runs the application using existing persistent state

* run-client - Runs the client against the application

Both the client and server are intended to run against installations of
the distributions.  You specify the locations of the installations using
the following properties:

* sgs.server.dir - The directory containing the SGS server installation.
  Note that this should be the directory that contains the sgs.sh file,
  not the higher level directory that also contains Berkeley DB and
  other third party libraries.  Note, too, that you need to have copied
  the third party libraries into this directory before attempting to use
  it.

* sgs.client.dir - The directory containing the SGS java client
  installation.

Here's the order of events for performing a compatibility test:

* Run the server with an empty persistence directory against the old
  release:

  ant -Dsgs.server.dir=SGS_SERVER_OLD run-server-clean

* Run the client against the old release:

  ant -Dsgs.client.dir=SGS_CLIENT_OLD run-client

* Kill the server

* Run the server with the existing persistence directory against the new
  release:

  ant -Dsgs.server.dir=SGS_SERVER_NEW run-server-clean

* Run the client against the new release:

  ant -Dsgs.client.dir=SGS_CLIENT_NEW run-client

* Kill the server

Note that the client should exit cleanly each time if the test worked
properly.

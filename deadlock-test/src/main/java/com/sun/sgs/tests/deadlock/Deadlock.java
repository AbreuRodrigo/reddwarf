/**
 * A simple PDS application that initiates a set of self-rescheduling
 * tasks which intentionally causes pathological contention between
 * them.
 * <p>
 * The application contains a list of {@link ManagedInteger} references
 * and there is a {@link SumTask} associated with each {@code ManagedInteger}
 * in the list.  Each task attempts to sum up the values of all of the integers,
 * and record this sum in the state of the associated integer.  Operating
 * concurrently, this causes significant contention as every task is trying
 * to acquire an exclusive write lock one one of the integers, while also
 * acquiring a read lock on all of the other integers.
 * <p>
 * A single {@link ReportTask} is also scheduled to run once per 
 * second which tracks
 * and reports on the successful update rate of a single {@code ManagedInteger}
 * in the list of {@code ManagedInteger}s.

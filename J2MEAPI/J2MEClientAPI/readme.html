<h1>Sun Game Server JME Client README</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Sun Game Server (SGS) JME Client code provides support for mobile clients
to talk to the SGS server. It provides support for mobile clients to
send and receive messages to/from SGS over HTTP.<br>
<h2>Building the code</h2>
The code was developed using Netbeans Mobility, the provided build.xml
should
work without Netbeans. The Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.2. must be
installed to build the code. (note it runs on either Windows or Linux).
The build.xml as is does not obfuscate the code. When we distribute
this library we should obfuscate the code, it cuts the size down
considerably, see the build.xml for how to do this.<br>
<br>
<h2>XML Changes</h2>
A parameter was added to the Discovery XML.<br>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;PARAMETER tag="pollInterval" value="500" /&gt; - This
specifies the frequency that the client should poll for events</li>
</ul>
<h2>Midlet Requirements</h2>
A midlet that uses the SGS client library needs to specify the
following additonal attributes in the JAD file<br>
<ul>
  <li>UsrMgrClassName:
com.sun.gi.comm.users.client.impl.JMEHttpUserManagerClient - this
specifies name of the user manager class</li>
  <li>XML-Discovery-URL: http://localhost:8080/FakeDiscovery.xml - This
is the location of the Discovery.xml file<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Classes/Interfaces</h2>
<ul>
  <li>JMEClientListenerInterface&nbsp; - Clients need to implement this
interface to receive events from the SGS</li>
  <li>JMEClientManager - Used to send events/message to the SGS server<br>
  </li>
</ul>

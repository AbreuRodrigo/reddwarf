Building the source:

The attached makefile (which should work with most versions of GNU Make) can be
used to build the Sun Gaming Server C API files and example client program by
invoking "make chatclient".

Running the example:

Once built, the executable (bin/chatclient) can be run from the command line.
Run "/bin/chatclient -u" for usage information.


Also, please note that the attached source code is still officially "under
development" and thus the APIs and/or implementations may change in the future.
